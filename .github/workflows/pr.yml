    # Build the fonts on macOS because we use the default overlap removal library
    # booleanOperations, which unfortunately inherits
    # https://sourceforge.net/p/polyclipping/bugs/195/ that manifests for certain
    # glyphs like `shade` and `dkshade`. The contour order makes no visual
    # difference, but is important for TrueType hinting, where instructions work on
    # point indices.  The font was originally build on macOS and then hinted in VTT,
    # so we have to use macOS to not potentially invalidate the hinting.
